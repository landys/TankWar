# TankWar

It's a 16-bit desktop game written in C including some ASM codes directly invoking BIOS interrupt and accessing video buffer. It's my C Course project of the first year undergraduate, when I had just learned pragramming for less than 1 year on June 2004. Actually at that time I could not distinguash between compile and link, and so I compiled all codes into one object. Funny. :)

## How to compile and Run the game

It's compiled and built in TC3, and it needs TC3 libraries. I put it in bin/TC30.zip. 

To build or run the game, you need a DOS environment. I tested it in Dos 7.1, Windows 98 and Windows XP 32-bit, and it worked well. But It couldn't run in Windows 7 even with compatibility mode. I also put Dos71 installation in bin/DOS71CD.ISO, and the Virtual Box vm file in bin/dos71-vb.zip. The TankWar exe file has already been put in C:\TankWar in the vm file.

Hence, the easiest way to try the game is to open the Virtual Box vm file with Virtual Box and run C:\TankWar\TankWar.exe.
